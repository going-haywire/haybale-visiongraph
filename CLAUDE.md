# haybale-visiongraph — orientation for Claude

This repo is a **haybale library** (a plugin) for the **haywire** visual-programming
framework. It wraps [Visiongraph](https://github.com/cansik/visiongraph) as haywire
types, nodes, widgets, and renderers. It is *not* the framework itself — the framework
lives in a separate monorepo.

## Develop from the monorepo, not from here

The framework monorepo sits next to this repo and **symlinks this repo's package into
its `barn/`**, so the same source files are editable from both sides:

```
haywire/
├── haywire-repo/                       ← framework monorepo (docs, .codemap, .insights, skills)
│   └── barn/haybale-visiongraph  →  symlink to ↓
└── haybale-visiongraph/                ← THIS repo (own git, .venv, releases)
    └── barn/haybale-visiongraph/haybale_visiongraph/   ← the actual source
```

**Prefer opening Claude sessions in `../haywire-repo`** and editing this library through
`barn/haybale-visiongraph/...`. There you get the framework docs, the `.codemap/` index,
the `.insights/` traps, the `haywire-*` skills, the live framework to import against, and
`uv run haywire` / `uv run pytest` running against the real framework. Edits there land in
*this* repo's files via the symlink; do git operations (commit, tag, release) from here.

If you are working in this repo directly (offline, packaging, or a fresh clone), the
authoritative framework knowledge is at:

- `../haywire-repo/docs/` — component authoring guides + architecture (start here for "how do I build a node/type/widget/renderer")
- `../haywire-repo/.codemap/INDEX.md` — repo layout map
- `../haywire-repo/.insights/` — non-obvious bugs and framework gotchas
- `../haywire-repo/CLAUDE.md` — framework conventions (reactive props, DI, testing rules)

## This repo

- Package: `haybale_visiongraph` under `barn/haybale-visiongraph/` (name `haybale-visiongraph-dev` in dev).
- `marketstall.toml` — the published library feed manifest; updated by `haywire share --save`.
- Setup, running, and sharing commands are in [README.md](README.md) — don't duplicate them here.

## Rules that carry over from the framework

These apply when editing this library; the long-form versions live in the monorepo:

- Read a file before editing it; grep for callers before changing a function signature.
- Follow the existing reactive-props / DI patterns — don't introduce singletons or
  alternate registration paths. Confirm before any change to class hierarchies or DI wiring.
- After multi-file changes, run `uv run pytest` (from the monorepo, against the live
  framework) and confirm it passes before calling work done.
